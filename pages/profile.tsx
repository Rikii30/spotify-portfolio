          A creative coder with a deep passion for both art and technology. With a background in painting and a love for crafting webpages, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and technical prowess. My curiosity extends beyond just coding â€“ I'm also intrigued by the insights data analysis can unveil. During my university years, I combined these interests to create Symphony Spot, a web application where users can discover new music, curated playlists, and even purchase vinyl records. Music has always been a significant part of my life; from learning Indian classical Carnatic music to curating playlists on Spotify, it's a constant source of inspiration. My dream is to curate a vast vinyl collection, showcasing the favorite artists of both myself and my friends. Beyond my technical skills, I'm known for being friendly and outgoing, valuing collaboration and strong relationships within a team. I'm eager to bring my unique blend of creativity, technical expertise, and love for music to the Spotify team, and I'm excited to gain more experience and knowledge.
